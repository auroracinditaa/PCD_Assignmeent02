# Image Enhancement Implementation using OpenCV

This project implements **image enhancement techniques** in Python using OpenCV.  
The program takes an input image, simulates degraded versions (blurred, dark, bright, and low-contrast), and then applies suitable enhancement methods to restore them.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Code Overview

1. **Upload and Read Image**
   - The image is uploaded using Google Colabâ€™s `files.upload()` and then read with OpenCV (`cv2.imread`).

2. **Degradation Simulation**
   - `make_blurred`: applies Gaussian Blur to simulate a blurred image.  
   - `make_dark`: reduces brightness using `convertScaleAbs`.  
   - `make_bright`: increases brightness using `convertScaleAbs`.  
   - `make_low_contrast`: decreases image contrast.

3. **Enhancement Functions**
   - **Blurred â†’ Sharpening filter** (kernel convolution).  
   - **Dark â†’ Gamma correction (brightening)**.  
   - **Bright â†’ Gamma correction (darkening)**.  
   - **Low-contrast â†’ Histogram Equalization** on the Y channel in YCrCb color space.

4. **Visualization**
   - The results are displayed in a grid using Matplotlib.  
   - Each row shows a degraded image (input) and its enhanced result (output).  
   - The first row shows the original image (unchanged).

## ðŸ”¹ Output

The program produces a figure with 5 rows Ã— 2 columns:

- Row 1: Original vs Original (unchanged)  
- Row 2: Blurred Image â†’ Enhanced (Sharpened)  
- Row 3: Dark Image â†’ Enhanced (Brightened)  
- Row 4: Bright Image â†’ Enhanced (Darkened)  
- Row 5: Low-contrast Image â†’ Enhanced (Equalized)

This demonstrates how different enhancement techniques can improve image quality depending on the type of degradation.
